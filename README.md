We get , R1 =	and hence Rf =

**DATE:**  
Here the negative sign indicates that the output voltage is 180 0 out of phase w
The differentiator is most commonly used in wave shaping circuits to detect high frequency components in an input signal and also as a rate–of–change detector in FM modulators.

Now choose fb = 10fa = 1 / 2πR1C1 Therefore, R1 = 1 / 2π(103)(10-7)
We get, CF = (1.59*103*10-7) / 15.9*103
= 0.01μF

## PROCEDURE

We get, CF = (1.59*103*10-7) / 15.9*103
4.	The output voltage is obtained in the CRO and the input and output voltage waveforms are plotted in a graph sheet.
